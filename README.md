# FAQ
Q: Are there questions here?

A: No.

# Building
To build the bot and use it for yourself, you need to have the dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed (located in the source folder). If you're too lazy to go look for it, here's the list of libraries:

- aiofiles
- aiohttp
- asyncio
- disnake
- humanize
- requests
- topggpy

Copy the example config file in the source folder and rename it to `config.py`, change the desired settings, and you're good to go!

❗ **NOTE: HAH! We have a license, you don't want to get sued, do you? Then don't steal without credit!**
